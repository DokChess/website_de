## 1.2 Quality Goals

The following table describes the key quality objectives of DokChess.
The order of the goals gives you a rough idea of their importance.

|Quality Goal     |Motivation/description                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Accessible example (Analysability) | Since DokChess first of all serves as a case study for software architects and developers, they quickly get the idea of design and implementation. |
| Platform appealing to experiments (Changeability) | Alternative algorithms and strategies, such as the evaluation of a chess position, can be implemented and integrated into the solution easily. |
| Using existing frontends (Interoperability) | DokChess can be integrated in existing graphical chess frontends with reasonable effort. |
| Acceptable playing strength (Attractiveness) | DokChess plays strong enough to beat weak opponents safely and at least challenges casual players. |
| Quick response to opponent's moves (Efficiency) | Since DokChess is used as live-demo in seminars and lectures, calculation of moves takes place quickly. |

The [quality scenarios in section 10](/10_qualityscenarios/) detail these goals and serve to evaluate their achievement.
