### Section 5

# Building Block View

This section describes the decomposition of DokChess into modules. These are also reflected in the package structure of the Java source code.
In DokChess we call modules of the first decomposition level _subsystems_.
The [→ Building Block View, Level 1](/en/05_buildingblockview/01_level1/) presents them including their interfaces.

For the subsystem Engine this overview also includes a more detailed breakdown into [→ Level 2](/en/05_buildingblockview/06_level_2_engine/).
